        Along the shores of Eastern Canada, within the province of Newfoundland & Labrador, located at its very south-eastern tip, sits a stretch of coastline dating back to ancient times. This area is known as Mistaken Point, a seemingly typical peninsula on the surface, with a deep history of life lying just below (literally)! Mistaken Point is one of Canada’s oldest fossil sites. However, to truly appreciate the significance of these fossils, from both historical and scientific aspects, we must first start off with a brief history of how Mistaken Point was discovered, along with its importance to Canada today.

        Mistaken Point received its name from being commonly mistaken for Cape Race by sailors travelling along Atlantic routes. This caused many ships to then turn north in hopes of spotting the Cape Race Lighthouse, only to find themselves running into dense fog and treacherous rocks. Over fifty ships have wrecked as a result, leading to the area being named appropriately so. Furthermore, Mistaken Point often passes nearby Trans-Atlantic trading routes, leading to several noteworthy crashes including the SS Artic, one of the largest U.S. passenger steamships during the 1850s.

        In comparison to its deadly shores however, the land itself appeared unremarkable to natives. Although the fossil beds of Mistaken Point had actually been known to nearby residents in the 20th century, as children would comment on strange “flowers within the rocks”, it wasn’t until later did the significance of these patterns become revealed. In June of 1967, Shiva Balak Misra, alongside his field assistant Paul Thompson, discovered more than just rocks. As a graduate student at Memorial University, tasked with mapping the Precambrian rocks along the coastline, what Misra found instead were fossils! But not just any old fossils, these were some of the oldest in the world! The fossils uncovered at Mistaken Point were the oldest metazoan fossils in North America, and the oldest Ediacaran fossils found in the world (dating back 580 – 560 million years ago).

        Mistaken Point quickly became recognized during the 1980s as an important find and for his work and discovery, the first fossil discovered there was name after him in 2007, Fractofusus misrai. In 1987, Mistaken Point was declared an ecological reserve. On July 17, 2016, Mistaken Point became a UNESCO World Heritage Site for being “an outstanding record of a critical milestone in the history of life on Earth” as stated by UNESCO themselves. Since its discovery, hundreds of fossils have been collected and can be found in the Royal Ontario Museum for all to see.
