        Mistaken Point is an ecological reserve that consists of many fossils found and documented by S.B. Misra that date back to the Precambrian Era. These unusual fossils are high in quantity and are found on exposed rock surfaces. The slabs comprised imprints of soft-bodied organisms that resembled fossils found in the late Precambrian Era. These Ediacaran fossils help to shed light on the history of life on Earth and development of multi-cellular organisms through time. Many of these fossils consist of organisms that lived in the bottom of the deep sea where there was no access to waves or light.

        Mistaken Point helps to preserve Ediacaran fossils by covering them with a blanket of volcanic ash which extends the life of these fossils. The fossil terrane found in Mistaken Point is deemed the term Avalonian Terrane which is a terrane found in Western Europe. This type of terrane was formed in the early Cambrian era when Pannotia split away and broke off from Gondwana.

        Due to its importance to our knowledge of the past, preservation is very key and drastic measures are being taken to ensure the site and fossils are preserved for the future. Daily patrols are conducted to ensure the site is maintained in a superior condition and a voluntary Fossil Guidance Program was formed to ensure further protection. Furthermore, collecting fossils is strictly prohibited and access to viewing many of these fossils is provided only with a tour guide.

        Despite the preservation efforts, threats such as theft, erosion processes and increased human activity continue to threaten the site. The level of security was increased following a potential heist in 1998, where potential thieves planned to carve fossils and steal them from mistaken point. However, the RCMP caught them in the act and stopped the theft from taking place. There is a high demand for fossils and following this near theft, advances to security were made to preserve both the environment and the fossils that the site contains. The daily monitoring helps to visualize and document the changes caused by erosion for scientific purposes. Erosion acts in slow manner and effects on fossils continues to be slow over time. The environmental impacts on human visiting to this site is also monitored closely and steps to improve preservation are taken if there is significant damage to the ecological reserve.
