      <h2>Main Fossil Forms</h2>
      <p>
        Ediacarans emerged around 635 million years ago, and went extinct around 550 million years ago, around the beginning of the Cambrian 541 million years ago.  The Ediacaran Period lasts 94 million years, from the end of the Cryogenian to the beginning of the Cambrian  They are classified as metazoans.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Ediacaran biota include the oldest specialized multicellular organisms
      </p>
      <p>
        Some Ediacarans were were probably ancient ancestors of sponges, jellyfish, sea urchins, sea pens, shrimp, lobsters and clams.  These are just the living relatives, other forms did not survive.  These ancestors do not bear much resemblance to their living relatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main fossil forms of the Ediacarans resembled worms, fronds, disks, or immobile bags.  The Ediacaran fossils found at the Mistaken Point Formation bear mostly spindle, frond, or radiating bush-like forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following his discovery, Misra grouped the Mistaken Point Ediacarans into five groups:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Spindle</li>
        <li>Leaf</li>
        <li>Round lobate</li>
        <li>Dentrite-like</li>
        <li>Radiating</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>
        Paleoecology considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        During this period of time, the moon was closer to the Earth, resulting in faster, stronger tides and shorter Earth days (due to shorter lunar months from tighter orbit).  This means there was increased tidal activity at this time, facilitating the development of life along coastlines and in shallow tides.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why were these the first fossils of life found on Earth? Were the Ediacarans Earth's first life?
      </p>
      <p>
        Life existed prior to the Ediacarans, however it did not preserve in conditions sufficient for modern preservation. For the majority of earlier organisms, they did not preserve simply because they were too small – simply Earth's earliest single-celled organisms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Ediacaran biota represents one of the earliest to have been found preserved to such a degree.  Perhaps in the future we will develop the means to discover even smaller and older fragments of fossilized life on Earth.
